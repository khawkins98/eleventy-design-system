## Eleventy Design System Demo

Welcome to a demonstration of "Eleventy as a design system". This website and [repository](#) sits alongside a [blog post](#), explaining how you can use this static site generator to create a bespoke and flexible design system.

This bare-bones example uses components written in Nunjucks with the [encapsulated macro pattern](https://www.trysmudford.com/blog/encapsulated-11ty-components/), but Eleventy provides an excellent array of alternative templating languages to suit your needs.

To see a fully-fledged instantiation of an Eleventy design system, check out [brand.malvernpanalytical.com](https://brand.malvernpanalytical.com/), including brand & tone of voice guidelines, versioning, links to Figma, prototyped page designs, and a full suite of components with thorough documentation.
